# cse210-ww-student-template

This is the starter code for students in the worldwide content version of CSE 210.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

- `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
- `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
- `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
- `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
- `final` - Starter projects for final project.

I chose the open-ended project.

The name of my program is Simple Inventory Manager.

What will be built?
I will create a C# program to provide an easier way to record product shipments when a cashier makes a sale to always know how many products they can sell.

This program will have a list of various options such as 1.Show inventory, 2. Create new product, 3. Update stock, 4. Record a sale, 5. Load inventory file. These options will have the following functionality:

1. Show Inventory: List the products created by the cashier and show the name, brand, price, available quantity and type of product (Food, Auto, Electronicsâ€¦) and any other details of the product.
2. Create new Product: Allow the cashier to create a new product by specifying the main data such as name, price and type. Depending on the type (Food, Car, Electronics...), the cashier must provide more or less product information.
3. Update stock: Allows the cashier to increase the available quantity of a specific product.
4. Record a sale: Show a list of available products to select the products the customer will purchase to decrease the available quantity.
5. Upload Inventory File: Allow the cashier to upload a file with the latest products created.
6. Save Inventory Balance: Save the list of products with their current available quantity in a file.

What classes will likely be created?

Product, Food, Car, Clothing, Plant, Electronic, Fabrics, Order, Cart, Client and InventoryManager.
